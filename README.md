# Code of Conduct (Notes)

## Goals

1. Do good work. Help each other.
1. Disagreements are expected. So is respect during those disagreements.
1. Don't be an asshole.
1. Sometimes you encounter raging assholes. These people distract from #1. Deal with them quickly and fiercely.
1. Sometimes you encounter aggressive victims — people who aggressively put themselves in the victim's position. These people distract from #1. Deal with them quickly and fiercely.
1. Someone having a different view of the world from you does not make them a bad person — someone acting like an asshole does.
1. Embrace volunteers. Don't waste time with non-volunteers. Getting involved with a project is expected to be an opt-in. We can hold your hand and help if you ask, but if you don't ask, then you're on your own.
1. Protect the "middle" of the community over the fringes at the outside.
1. It's always a good thing to shut up and listen to people who disagree with you. Try to learn something from them, even if you don't ever agree.
1. Sometimes, it doesn't matter if you're right. Working together to move forward can sometimes be more "right" than the right answer.
1. The Internet can be a hostile place. To participate in it, you may need to develop thicker skin. You will inevitably get your feelings hurt at some point. You may need to suck it up and move on with your life. Do not be confused — this does _not_ make an attempt to justify people being assholes on purpose. But there are people out there who are socially "tone-deaf" and don't realize it. Shake it off, talk to them if you think it's a problem, then move on.
1. You can't change anybody but yourself. Embrace that truth or be frustrated forever.

## Mostly agree, or find good

* http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=blob_plain;f=README.MAILINGLIST_RULES;hb=HEAD (good about GTD)
* http://citizencodeofconduct.org (good about GTD and inclusion)
* https://geekfeminism.org/about/code-of-conduct/ (mostly agree; some things are listed as "harassment" that never crossed my mind. Need more input here to make an informed decision.)
* http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct (good about GTD and inclusion)
* https://www.python.org/community/diversity/ (good about inclusion; warm fuzzies)
* https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/ (this + reporting + enforcement comes across as being extremely level-headed)
* https://www.debian.org/code_of_conduct (solid, mature, level-headed)
* https://medium.com/@jmaynard/a-contribution-policy-for-open-source-that-works-bfc4600c9d83 (short & sweet; could be a smaller portion of a larger guide; doesn't address enough)
* https://github.com/rosarior/Code-of-Merit/blob/master/CODE_OF_MERIT.md (short & sweet; could be a smaller portion of a larger guide; doesn't address enough)

## Mostly disagree, find bad, or believe it doesn't do enough

* https://github.com/domgetter/NCoC (Cares about code at the exclusion of all else. This is not an accurate reflection of the human race.)
* http://contributor-covenant.org (Seems to come from a good place, but appears to be a very poor execution. Seems to value non-code _far_ more than code.)

## Other input

* http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/6224 (Does not see the good in people by default. Yes, there are bad people out there, but they are the minority instead of the majority.)
* http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6907 (Some people are f****d up. From this post, it's people on BOTH sides. Extremism at its worst.)
* https://blog.randi.io/2015/12/31/the-developer-formerly-known-as-freebsdgirl/ (We want to avoid garbage like this from happening to people.)
